# dotfiles

In my opinion *which I respect very much* what you have stumbled across right
here is the best dotfiles money can buy. I have and continue to spend a
ridiculous amount of time grooming and enhancing this treasure trove of
developer tools. So if you love the command line, and I know you do, then do
yourself a favor, grab a copy and get to coding.

## Installation

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/JarrodCTaylor/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles/install-scripts
zsh OSX/install-packages.sh
zsh OSX/create-symlink.sh
# or
zsh Linux/install-packages.sh
zsh Linux/create-symlink.sh
```

# Contents

## Zsh

At the configurations core is the Z shell. When you first open the terminal you
will notice the custom prompt. The prompt takes up the full width of the
terminal and is two or three lines depending on if you are currently in a
directory that is a git repo. The image below details the core components of
the prompt. Additionally if you enter a directory that shares the name of a
Python virtualenv it will be activated automatically and indicated visually in
the prompt. The same is true for a directory containing node modules.

### Customizing Zsh

The zsh setup is designed to allow customization. I recommend that you maintain
a separate version controlled repository of configurations for all of your
settings and pull that repository into the `dotfiles/custom-configs` directory.
Any file ending with `.sh` will automatically be sourced when you open a shell.
You can use this to add additional alias, functions, etc.


## Tmux

A must have for pair programming sessions. The most notable features are the
themed status line pictured below and the non-stock leader key \<C-Space>

## Vim

The vim configuration is the life blood of the dotfiles. Vim is my primary
editor and I spend the majority of everyday banging away inside its modal
buffers. You can interactively explore the key mappings by opening an empty
buffer and typing `|<Space>` in normal mode. This will open a unite menu that
lists all of the shortcuts with a description and the key mapping that triggers
it. You can scroll through the list with \<C-J> \<C-k> or filter the options by
typing.

### Customizing Vim

The Vim setup is designed to allow customization. I recommend that you maintain
a separate version controlled repository of configurations for all your
settings and pull that repository into the `dotfiles/custom-configs` directory.
Any file ending with `.vim` will automatically be sourced.

If you would like to add additional plugins copy a file from
`vim/plugin-configs` and updated it as needed then save that file with a name
that ends in `-plugin.vim`.

If you would like to not load some of the plugins that I have configured you
can create a file named `custom-init.vim` in there you can specify an array of
plugins to exclude. For example `hard-time` is not for the novice Vim user. So
in your `custom-init.vim` you can add the following line.

``` text
let g:exclude = ["vim-hardtime.vim"]
```

this array can contain the name of any file in `vim/plugin-configs`


## Conky

Conky in two flavors 2 and 4 core. The setup script will ask you which one you
would like to install.

## Misc Customization

You can use your own configuration file in place of any of the following
 * gitconfig
 * coffeelint.json
 * psqlrc
 * tigrc
 * tmux.conf

To do so you just need to include a file of the same name in your version
controlled directory that you save into `custom-configs` the create symlinks
scripts will link the files properly.
